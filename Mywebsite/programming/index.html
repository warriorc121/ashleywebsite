            <h1>Programming</h1>
            <p>while I am by no means an expert programmer, I am still greatly intrigued by computers and how they work.</p>
            <p>Fun fact: This website is my first serious coding project.</p>
            <p>my main interests in this field revolve around web developement, but I am considering trying my hand at some light game developement 
                as my programming skills improve
            </p>
            <h2>Current projects I am working on:</h2>
            <p>This website. I am planning on adding more features to this website and making it look better</p>
            <p>Some little novelty scripts in python</p>
            <p>LATER A remake of a classic pre NES video game. </p>
