            <h2> Work experience</h2>
            <p>I currently work at Sparta Lanes. I have been working there since September doing a mixture of cleaning and assisting customers while they are bowling.</p>
            <p>other positions i have held have been working as a religious school teacher, working at Shoprite in the bakery, and working FOH at Chick Fil A</p>
            <p>I am currently in school for a general liberal arts degree, however I am still exploring what i want to turn into a career. Some of the ideas include writing, programming, and coaching.</p>
            <p>On this site I plan on keeping updated what I am working on in those areas, with room to add or remove based on how my interests evolve over time </p>
